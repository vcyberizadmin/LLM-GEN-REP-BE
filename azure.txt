| Azure Resource Needed                | No. of Units / Amount of Storage or Compute Needed                |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| App Service (Linux, Standard B1)    | 1 (for FastAPI backend, scalable as needed)                       |
| Static Web App (or App Service)     | 1 (for React frontend, or use same App Service as backend)        |
| Storage Account (Blob Storage)      | 1 (for file uploads, recommend 10-50 GB to start, scalable)       |
| Application Insights                | 1 (for monitoring backend/frontend, optional but recommended)      |
| Key Vault                           | 1 (for storing API keys/secrets, e.g., ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)         |
| Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL | 0 (not required unless you want persistent chat history in DB)    |
| Azure Files (optional)              | 0-1 (if you want shared file storage across instances)             |
| Bandwidth (Outbound Data Transfer)  | Estimate 50-100 GB/month (depends on file size/usage)             |
| vCPU (App Service)                  | 1-2 vCPU (Standard B1/B2, scale up for more users)                |
| RAM (App Service)                   | 1-4 GB (Standard B1/B2, scale up for more users)                  |

**Notes:**
- For most small/medium orgs, start with Standard B1 App Service (1 vCPU, 1.75 GB RAM) and scale as needed.
- Storage can be increased as file upload volume grows.
- If you want to persist chat history beyond browser localStorage, add a managed database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- Use Key Vault for secure management of API keys and secrets.
- Application Insights is recommended for monitoring and diagnostics.
- For high availability, consider scaling App Service to 2+ instances and using Azure Front Door or Load Balancer.
